# OneNote 2010

This is a toolkit I am developing to complement OneNote 2010
I needed a few functions that the Onetastic kit doesnt seem to be able to do quickly so I am doing it in VBA

Currently the script can do
a) Export each page as pdf/word with a cleanup of the title (add prefix and a cleanup)
b) Add references to the page based on how I tend to reference my pages 


They are quite specific to my use case, but I think it is a good starting point for other uses
(it took me ages to find out how to do these things in VBA so hopefully you will be able to build on this)
